# Wine Fraud Detection with Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning techniques to detect fraud in wine data. It analyzes red and white wine samples and applies preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and classification using a Support Vector Machine (SVM).

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset used is `wine.csv`, which includes wine samples labeled with quality and type.

## 🔍 Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using seaborn and matplotlib
- Feature encoding and scaling
- Train/test split
- SVM model training and hyperparameter tuning using `GridSearchCV`
- Model evaluation using confusion matrix and classification report

## 📦 Dependencies

Install required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
